  // 2. above, blob has to be converted from raw form that it's in to json, that's why the '.json()'(which if you console log just blob you can see is a method on the object blob). -> Below, This will then return another promise which is why we have to do .then again (pretty much any time you see '.then', it's a promise, i think)
